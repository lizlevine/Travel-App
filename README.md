# Get Your Trip Together!

It is designed to have the user search for a destination, make comments, or create their own destination. If they choose to see trips from other users, they're given the option to click . Should they click on "contribute here", a pop-up modal will appear where they can share and the comment will be saved in MySQL db. They also have the option to do a Yelp search.
